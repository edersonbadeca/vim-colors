# vim-colors
Awesome collection of themes for vim 

# Usage
```
$ git clone git@github.com:edersonbadeca/vim-colors.git ~/.vim/colors/
```

### Edit your .vimrc
colorscheme [name of theme without .vim]

## TroubleShotting
if you already have some files in your .vim/colors you will not be able to clone on this dir 
you may have to follow [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2411031/how-do-i-clone-into-a-non-empty-directory)

Some of these themes needs a 256 colors terminal:
on your vimrc try to put this command:
```
set term=screen-256color
```

if this doesn't work, try to find a terminal that supports 256-colors-schemas.

Enjoy =)
